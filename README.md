# Sonic Run
Sonic Run is an endless run game inspired by the famous Sonic franchise,
created by *SEGA*. The game has been developed for the final project of Interactive Graphics 2022 course at Sapienza University of Rome. In Sonic Run,
the player takes role of Sonic to challenge him/herself by running through
many different obstacles and enemies. Get as many rings as possible!

You can find all game details [here](documentation/report.pdf). 

The game is supported in most of the modern browsers. I recommend to run the game on Chrome for best performance.
